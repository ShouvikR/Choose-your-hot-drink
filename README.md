# Choose-your-hot-drink

There are list of small projects that I've done during my Web Dev Bootcamp in Juno. Its one of them. 
I used: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript for this project.
You can select your drink either Coffee or Tea.
Also you can set the price range.
Based on you selection the app will display a random place, that has been stored on an array. 
I used few specific Tea & coffee places but we can use API instead.
Enjoy your drink at your Favorite place!!
